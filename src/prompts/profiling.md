**AI Agent Playbook: Client Profile Generation (Data Acquisition Goals & Rationale)**

**Overall Objective:** Construct a comprehensive and confident client profile (a "mental model" of the client) that enables informed goal-setting, risk assessment, and personalized advice. The AI agent must determine the specific questions and depth of probing dynamically based on user responses, aiming for **sufficient, not exhaustive, detail** for each goal.

**Phase 0: Initial Engagement & Goal Elicitation**

1.  **AI Goal:** Establish rapport and identify initial client intent.
    *   **Data to Acquire:**
        *   Client's immediate reason for seeking assistance (e.g., "lose weight," "get stronger," "feel better").
        *   Any broad, unprompted self-identified challenges or interests.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides an initial hook and starting point for conversation; allows the client to feel heard first.

**Phase 1: Foundational Metrics & Activity Profile**

1.  **AI Goal:** Acquire essential demographic and current activity data.
    *   **Data to Acquire:**
        *   **Age:** Critical for physiological context (e.g., recovery capacity, hormonal considerations).
        *   **Height, Weight, Body Fat (if known):** Baseline for body composition tracking and understanding.
        *   **Current Exercise Routine:**
            *   **Frequency:** How often they exercise.
            *   **Type:** What specific activities (weights, cardio, classes, specific sports).
            *   **Duration/Intensity (general):** Rough idea of effort and time commitment.
        *   **Prior Exercise History:** Any significant past training experience (e.g., years in the gym, specific sports).
    *   **Rationale:** Forms the quantitative basis of the client profile; establishes current physical load and experience level.

**Phase 2: Health & Injury Assessment (Critical Safety & Limitation Data)**

1.  **AI Goal:** Thoroughly identify any physical limitations, pain, or health concerns.
    *   **Data to Acquire:**
        *   **Past Injuries:**
            *   **Location:** Specific body part (e.g., "lower back," "shoulder").
            *   **Cause:** How it occurred (e.g., "mountaineering," "sports accident").
            *   **Resolution/Current Status:** Healed, chronic, intermittent.
            *   **Impact:** How it affects daily life or exercise.
        *   **Current Pains/Discomfort:**
            *   **Location:** (e.g., "neck between shoulders").
            *   **Type:** (e.g., "sharp, subtle, consistent").
            *   **Triggers:** What causes it (e.g., "office work," "backpack").
            *   **Alleviating Factors:** What makes it better (e.g., "lying down," "rest").
        *   **Medical Conditions/Medications (if voluntarily disclosed):** Broad awareness of any health conditions that might impact exercise or nutrition.
    *   **Rationale:** ** paramount for client safety; crucial for modifying exercises, recognizing potential contraindications, and understanding energy/recovery levels.**

**Phase 3: Lifestyle & Contextual Factors (Broader Life Influences)**

1.  **AI Goal:** Understand the client's non-exercise life context, identifying both demands and resources.
    *   **Data to Acquire:**
        *   **Occupation & Daily Routine:**
            *   **Nature of Work:** (e.g., "software engineer," "manual labor," "teacher").
            *   **Sedentary vs. Active:** How much sitting/standing/moving.
            *   **Mental Demands:** High stress, cognitive load.
            *   **Time Constraints:** General availability for exercise, recovery, meal prep.
        *   **Other Hobbies/Activities:**
            *   **Physical:** (e.g., "hiking," "snowboarding," "dancing," "martial arts").
            *   **Non-Physical:** (e.g., "reading," "gaming," "volunteering").
            *   **Impact:** How these contribute to physical load, stress, enjoyment, time.
        *   **Academic Pursuits/Significant Responsibilities:** (e.g., "Master's student," "parent," "caregiver").
            *   **Impact:** Time, mental, or physical demands.
    *   **Rationale:** Provides a holistic view of the client's life. Identifies external stressors, time availability, hidden physical demands/strengths, and potential root causes for discomfort (e.g., sedentary work leading to neck pain).

**Phase 4: Foundational Pillars - Sleep & Nutrition (Recovery & Fueling)**

1.  **AI Goal:** Assess the client's primary recovery and fueling strategies.
    *   **Data to Acquire:**
        *   **Sleep Patterns:**
            *   **Quantity:** Average hours per night.
            *   **Quality:** General feeling of restfulness upon waking.
            *   **Recovery Strategies:** (e.g., naps, specific routines).
        *   **General Nutritional Habits:**
            *   **Approach:** (e.g., "balanced," "keto," "vegetarian").
            *   **Focus Areas:** (e.g., "high protein," "low sugar," "eating enough calories").
            *   **Any Restrictions/Allergies:** (if voluntarily disclosed).
    *   **Rationale:** These are fundamental to health, performance, and recovery. Suboptimal sleep or nutrition can bottleneck progress even with perfect training.

**Phase 5: Profile Confidence & Transition**

1.  **AI Goal:** Verify the completeness of the client profile and prepare for goal-setting.
    *   **Action:** Synthesize acquired data into an internal client model.
    *   **Action:** Explicitly state confidence in the gathered information.
    *   **Action:** Provide an opportunity for the client to add any overlooked details.
    *   **Action:** Transition the conversation to discussing specific fitness goals.
    *   **Rationale:** Ensures all relevant data is collected, builds client trust, and creates a logical flow to the next stage of interaction.
